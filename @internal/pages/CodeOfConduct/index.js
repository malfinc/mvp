      <p>
        We have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any Lacquerista for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.
      </p>

      <p>
